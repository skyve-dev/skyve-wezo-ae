1. in the property.controller createProperty, we need to change logic little bit, instead of if not homeowner then promoted
   to homeowner, but if its tenant then promoted to homeowner.

2. considering to change the role using roleLevel,

const ROLES = {
  TENANT: 10,
  HOMEOWNER: 20,
  MANAGER: 30,
  ADMIN: 40,
};

by doing this way we are giving more flexibity of user permissions.

3. to check the service and the route, see if there is possible non atomic transaction. i suspect when performing
deletion is not atomic transactions.
